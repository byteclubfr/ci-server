# deploy-server

Continuous integration server experiment written in node.js

## Configuration

Look at `projects/sample/config.json` for a very common example.

The options should be self-explanatory, and that'll be enough at this point.

## Work in progress

What's done:

* receive github hooks
* test
* deploy

Still missing:

* moar doc
* CLI to help setup your repo (deploy key, hookâ€¦)
* notifications
* update commit status
* history
